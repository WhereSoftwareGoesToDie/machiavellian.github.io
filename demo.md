Machiavelli comes bundled with a sample endpoint for demonstration purposes. 

To invoke: 

	gem install sinatra sinatra-reloader
	ruby simple_endpoint

	# New terminal
	bundle exec rails server

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

The `config/settings/development.yml` file is already configured to use this sample endpoint as a data store.
